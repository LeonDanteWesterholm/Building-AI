# Next Meal Recommender

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

The **Next Meal Recommender** app uses AI to provide personalized meal recommendations based on users’ dietary preferences, available ingredients, and nutritional needs. It helps users make healthier food choices with ease by automating the meal selection process.

## Background

Many people struggle with meal planning, especially when trying to align their food choices with specific dietary goals or restrictions. This app solves the issue of decision fatigue around what to eat, making it easier for individuals to stay on track with their nutrition goals. As someone deeply invested in health and fitness, I know how difficult it can be to make the right food choices consistently, which is why I wanted to create an AI solution that simplifies this process. The ability to generate healthy, easy-to-cook recipes from ingredients users already have at home adds convenience, reducing food waste as well.

Key problems addressed:
* Difficulty in planning nutritious meals consistently.
* Lack of time or knowledge to select meals based on dietary goals.
* Reducing food waste by using available ingredients efficiently.

## How is it used?

The user inputs their dietary preferences (e.g., vegan, keto), fitness goals (e.g., muscle gain, weight loss), and available ingredients at home. The AI then generates a list of nutritious meals tailored to those preferences and ingredients. Users can also integrate fitness tracking, allowing the app to adjust meal recommendations based on their recent activity levels.

This app would be most useful for:
* Fitness enthusiasts who want meal recommendations aligned with their training.
* People with specific dietary restrictions or health conditions (e.g., gluten-free, diabetic).
* Anyone looking for convenient, healthy meal options based on what they have in their kitchen.

## Data sources and AI methods

The app would leverage existing public databases with nutritional information, such as the **USDA Food Composition Database**, as well as **recipe APIs** like **Spoonacular** or **Edamam** for recipe generation. User input data (preferences, fitness goals) would be stored in a secure database and used for personalization.

AI methods:
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to process user inputs and ingredient lists.
* **Collaborative filtering** to suggest meals based on user history and preferences.
* **Reinforcement learning** to improve meal recommendations over time based on user feedback.

## Challenges

The app may not be able to address:
* The accuracy of recommendations if data input is incomplete or incorrect.
* Cultural or personal preferences outside of dietary restrictions.
* Ethical considerations around food allergies and ensuring complete accuracy in ingredient analysis.

## What next?

In the future, the app could:
* Integrate with grocery delivery services to automatically create shopping lists based on missing ingredients.
* Expand into a community platform where users can share meal plans, reviews, and tweaks to the recommended meals.
* Add voice-activated features to help users cook hands-free.

To move forward, I’d need:
* Access to larger datasets and APIs for recipes and nutritional information.
* Additional machine learning expertise to improve personalization algorithms.
* Possibly partnership with grocery services for delivery integration.
